        I am an initiative-taking, well-organized GIS Analyst with six years of
        dedicated experience in geographical information systems (GIS) coupled
        with one year of impactful Project Manager expertise. My career spans
        across diverse projects, where I have leveraged my technical proficiency
        in GIS tools and methodologies to deliver precise spatial analysis,
        robust mapping solutions, and strategic insights. My proficiency extends
        to data collection, analysis, and visualization, employing advanced GIS
        software to optimize processes and drive informed decision-making.
        Additionally, my year-long tenure as a Project Manager honed my ability
        to lead cross-functional teams, manage timelines, and ensure project
        objectives align seamlessly with organizational goals.
